## WEB FRAMEWORK

GeeksforGeeks describes ‘web application frameworks’ or ‘web frameworks’ as “a software framework that is designed to support the development of web applications including web services, web resources and web APIs”. In simple words, web frameworks are a piece of software that offers a way to create and run web applications. 

## TYPES OF WEB FRAMEWORK

# 1. Server-side Framework:
Server-side frameworks handle HTTP requests, database control and management, URL mapping, etc.
- NET (C#)
- Django (Python)
- Ruby on Rails (Ruby)
- Express (JavaScript/Node.JS)
- Symfony (PHP)
- Flask (Python)

# 2. Client-side Framework:
Client-side frameworks don’t take care of the business logic like the server-side ones. They function inside the browser.
- Angular
- Ember.JS
- Vue.JS
- React.JS

## FLASK
Flask is a lightweight WSGI web application framework. It is designed to make getting started quick and easy, with the ability to scale up to complex applications. It began as a simple wrapper around Werkzeug and Jinja and has become one of the most popular Python web application frameworks.

## JINJA
A Jinja template is simply a text file. Jinja can generate any text-based format (HTML, XML, CSV, LaTeX, etc.). A Jinja template doesn’t need to have a specific extension: .html, .xml, or any other extension is just fine.
